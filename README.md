# Sudoku_KO

Welcome, to my sudoku puzzle.

This is a sudoku web application built using C# and the javascript framework knockout.js. The project was inspired from an excersize created by the great coder name Zoran Horvat. (found here) http://codinghelmet.com/exercises/sudoku-solver

The majority of the heavy lifting is done in the SudokuPuzzle class and the static SudHelper class as far as handling the server side puzzle logic. The front end knockout code is located in the View called Play. 

Try out the application here https://www.farmfoodweb.net

Enjoy!
