# Sudoku_KO

Sudoku was the first application I wrote using react.js. However due to a series of issues I was facing with updates and bugs I decided to try building the same application using a different front end framework I was already very familiar with called Knockout. This application is what resulted. There are a number of slight differences however the basic game should work the same. With this version I was able to fix a bug I was unable to fix in the react solution, namely creating invalid versions of the game (see my Sudoku repository for more information). 

The majority of the heavy lifting is done in the SudokuPuzzle class and the static SudHelper class as far as handling the server side puzzle logic. The front end knockout code is located in the View called Play. 

Very soon I will post a link to the demo application. 

Enjoy!
